Hi All,


 


1. STM3220G-EVAL board:


 


  1.1. For working in RMII mode, when clock is provided by external oscillator U3, 

         JP5 must not be fitted, resistor R212 has to be removed and SB1 closed.

1.2. 50MHz external clock not work (U3). 

2. Phantom:

2.1. Electronic board executes the entire cycle of initialization, comes in the "Task manager" and is idle.
  2.2. In an attempt to establish an Internet connection, your PC displays the message “Hardware error.”

2.3. The reason and what should be done are set out in the attached document.


3. Let me know if you want, so I continued to work.


 


Best Regards
