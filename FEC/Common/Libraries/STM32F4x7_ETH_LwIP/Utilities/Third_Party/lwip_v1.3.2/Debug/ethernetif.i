 * supported in this mode.)
 *
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, the locale interface (setlocale, etc) does
 * not exist. One preselected locale and one preselected encoding is then used
 * directly. That locale can not be changed during runtime. The preselected
 * locale and encoding is choosen by defining at most one of _LOCALE_USE_xxx
 * and at most one of _ENCODING_USE_xxx. The default is to use the "C" locale
 * and the single byte encoding, respectively.

 * Description
 * -----------
 *
 * If locks are to be used (_DLIB_MULTI_THREAD != 0), the following options
 * has to be used in ilink: 
 *   --redirect __iar_Locksyslock=__iar_Locksyslock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Unlocksyslock=__iar_Unlocksyslock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Lockfilelock=__iar_Lockfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Unlockfilelock=__iar_Unlockfilelock_mtx
 *   --keep     __iar_Locksyslock_mtx
 * and, if C++ is used, also:
 *   --redirect __iar_Initdynamicfilelock=__iar_Initdynamicfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Dstdynamicfilelock=__iar_Dstdynamicfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Lockdynamicfilelock=__iar_Lockdynamicfilelock_mtx
 *   --redirect __iar_Unlockdynamicfilelock=__iar_Unlockdynamicfilelock_mtx
 * Xlink uses similar options (-e and -g). The following lock interface must
 * also be implemented: 
 *   typedef void *__iar_Rmtx;                   // Lock info object
 *
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxinit(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Initialize a system lock
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxdst(__iar_Rmtx *);     // Destroy a system lock
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxlock(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Lock a system lock
 *   void __iar_system_Mtxunlock(__iar_Rmtx *);  // Unlock a system lock
 * The interface handles locks for the heap, the locale, the file system
 * structure, the initialization of statics in functions, etc. 
 *
 * The following lock interface is optional to be implemented:
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxinit(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Initialize a file lock
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxdst(__iar_Rmtx *);     // Destroy a file lock
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxlock(__iar_Rmtx *);    // Lock a file lock
 *   void __iar_file_Mtxunlock(__iar_Rmtx *);  // Unlock a file lock
 * The interface handles locks for each file stream.
 * 
 * These three once-initialization symbols must also be defined, if the 
 * default initialization later on in this file doesn't work (done in 
 * DLib_product.h):
 *
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_TYPE
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_MACRO(control_variable, init_function)
 *   _DLIB_THREAD_LOCK_ONCE_TYPE_INIT
 *
 * If an external TLS interface is used, the following must
 * be defined:
 *   typedef int __iar_Tlskey_t;
 *   typedef void (*__iar_Tlsdtor_t)(void *);
 *   int __iar_Tlsalloc(__iar_Tlskey_t *, __iar_Tlsdtor_t); 
 *                                                    // Allocate a TLS element
 *   int __iar_Tlsfree(__iar_Tlskey_t);               // Free a TLS element
 *   int __iar_Tlsset(__iar_Tlskey_t, void *);        // Set a TLS element
 *   void *__iar_Tlsget(__iar_Tlskey_t);              // Get a TLS element
 *

/*
 * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
 * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
 * application code.
 *
 * list_ts can only store pointers to list_item_ts.  Each ListItem_t contains a
 * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
 * descending item value order.
 *
 * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
 * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
 * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
 * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
 * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
 * the list.
 *
 * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
 * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
 * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
 * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
 * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
 * the list item itself.

 * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore
 * by rights should be declared volatile.  However, they are only modified in a
 * functionally atomic way (within critical sections of with the scheduler
 * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
 * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
 * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
 * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
 * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
 * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
 * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
 * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
 * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
 * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
 * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
 * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
 * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
 * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
 * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
 * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
 * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below
 * will simply #define configLIST_VOLATILE away completely.
 *
 * To use volatile list structure members then add the following line to
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (without the quotes):
 * "#define configLIST_VOLATILE volatile"

 *
 * Delay a task until a specified time.  This function can be used by periodic
 * tasks to ensure a constant execution frequency.
 *
 * This function differs from vTaskDelay () in one important aspect:  vTaskDelay () will
 * cause a task to block for the specified number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay () is
 * called.  It is therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay () by itself to generate a fixed
 * execution frequency as the time between a task starting to execute and that task
 * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
 * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
 * each time it executes].
 *
 * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
 * is called, vTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
 * unblock.
 *
 * The constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * @param pxPreviousWakeTime Pointer to a variable that holds the time at which the
 * task was last unblocked.  The variable must be initialised with the current time
 * prior to its first use (see the example below).  Following this the variable is
 * automatically updated within vTaskDelayUntil ().
 *
 * @param xTimeIncrement The cycle time period.  The task will be unblocked at
 * time *pxPreviousWakeTime + xTimeIncrement.  Calling vTaskDelayUntil with the
 * same xTimeIncrement parameter value will cause the task to execute with
 * a fixed interface period.
 *
 * Example usage:

 // Perform an action every 10 ticks.

 * must also then provide definitions for
 * portCONFIGURE_TIMER_FOR_RUN_TIME_STATS() and portGET_RUN_TIME_COUNTER_VALUE()
 * to configure a peripheral timer/counter and return the timers current count
 * value respectively.  The counter should be at least 10 times the frequency of
 * the tick count.
 *
 * NOTE 1: This function will disable interrupts for its duration.  It is
 * not intended for normal application runtime use but as a debug aid.
 *
 * Setting configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS to 1 will result in a total
 * accumulated execution time being stored for each task.  The resolution
 * of the accumulated time value depends on the frequency of the timer
 * configured by the portCONFIGURE_TIMER_FOR_RUN_TIME_STATS() macro.
 * Calling vTaskGetRunTimeStats() writes the total execution time of each
 * task into a buffer, both as an absolute count value and as a percentage
 * of the total system execution time.
 *
 * NOTE 2:
 *
 * This function is provided for convenience only, and is used by many of the
 * demo applications.  Do not consider it to be part of the scheduler.
 *
 * vTaskGetRunTimeStats() calls uxTaskGetSystemState(), then formats part of the
 * uxTaskGetSystemState() output into a human readable table that displays the
 * amount of time each task has spent in the Running state in both absolute and
 * percentage terms.
 *
 * vTaskGetRunTimeStats() has a dependency on the sprintf() C library function
 * that might bloat the code size, use a lot of stack, and provide different
 * results on different platforms.  An alternative, tiny, third party, and
 * limited functionality implementation of sprintf() is provided in many of the
 * FreeRTOS/Demo sub-directories in a file called printf-stdarg.c (note
 * printf-stdarg.c does not provide a full snprintf() implementation!).
 *
 * It is recommended that production systems call uxTaskGetSystemState() directly
 * to get access to raw stats data, rather than indirectly through a call to
 * vTaskGetRunTimeStats().

 * operation from multiple queues or semaphores simultaneously.
 *
 * See FreeRTOS/Source/Demo/Common/Minimal/QueueSet.c for an example using this
 * function.
 *
 * A queue set must be explicitly created using a call to xQueueCreateSet()
 * before it can be used.  Once created, standard FreeRTOS queues and semaphores
 * can be added to the set using calls to xQueueAddToSet().
 * xQueueSelectFromSet() is then used to determine which, if any, of the queues
 * or semaphores contained in the set is in a state where a queue read or
 * semaphore take operation would be successful.
 *
 * Note 1:  See the documentation on http://wwwFreeRTOS.org/RTOS-queue-sets.html
 * for reasons why queue sets are very rarely needed in practice as there are
 * simpler methods of blocking on multiple objects.
 *
 * Note 2:  Blocking on a queue set that contains a mutex will not cause the
 * mutex holder to inherit the priority of the blocked task.
 *
 * Note 3:  An additional 4 bytes of RAM is required for each space in a every
 * queue added to a queue set.  Therefore counting semaphores that have a high
 * maximum count value should not be added to a queue set.
 *
 * Note 4:  A receive (in the case of a queue) or take (in the case of a
 * semaphore) operation must not be performed on a member of a queue set unless
 * a call to xQueueSelectFromSet() has first returned a handle to that set member.
 *
 * @param uxEventQueueLength Queue sets store events that occur on
 * the queues and semaphores contained in the set.  uxEventQueueLength specifies
 * the maximum number of events that can be queued at once.  To be absolutely
 * certain that events are not lost uxEventQueueLength should be set to the
 * total sum of the length of the queues added to the set, where binary
 * semaphores and mutexes have a length of 1, and counting semaphores have a
 * length set by their maximum count value.  Examples:
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a queue of length 5, another queue of length 12,
 *    and a binary semaphore, then uxEventQueueLength should be set to
 *    (5 + 12 + 1), or 18.
 *  + If a queue set is to hold three binary semaphores then uxEventQueueLength
 *    should be set to (1 + 1 + 1 ), or 3.
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of
 *    5, and a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of 3, then
 *    uxEventQueueLength should be set to (5 + 3), or 8.

 *
 * <i>Macro</i> that creates a counting semaphore by using the existing
 * queue mechanism.
 *
 * Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:
 *
 * 1) Counting events.
 *
 *    In this usage scenario an event handler will 'give' a semaphore each time
 *    an event occurs (incrementing the semaphore count value), and a handler
 *    task will 'take' a semaphore each time it processes an event
 *    (decrementing the semaphore count value).  The count value is therefore
 *    the difference between the number of events that have occurred and the
 *    number that have been processed.  In this case it is desirable for the
 *    initial count value to be zero.
 *
 * 2) Resource management.
 *
 *    In this usage scenario the count value indicates the number of resources
 *    available.  To obtain control of a resource a task must first obtain a
 *    semaphore - decrementing the semaphore count value.  When the count value
 *    reaches zero there are no free resources.  When a task finishes with the
 *    resource it 'gives' the semaphore back - incrementing the semaphore count
 *    value.  In this case it is desirable for the initial count value to be
 *    equal to the maximum count value, indicating that all resources are free.
 *
 * @param uxMaxCount The maximum count value that can be reached.  When the
 *        semaphore reaches this value it can no longer be 'given'.
 *
 * @param uxInitialCount The count value assigned to the semaphore when it is
 *        created.
 *
 * @return Handle to the created semaphore.  Null if the semaphore could not be
 *         created.
 *
 * Example usage:
 <pre>
 SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore;

 void vATask( void * pvParameters )
 {
 SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore = NULL;

    // Semaphore cannot be used before a call to xSemaphoreCreateCounting().
    // The max value to which the semaphore can count should be 10, and the
    // initial value assigned to the count should be 0.
    xSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateCounting( 10, 0 );

    if( xSemaphore != NULL )
    {
        // The semaphore was created successfully.
        // The semaphore can now be used.
    }

  *           - Configuration section that allows to select:
  *              - The device used in the target application
  *              - To use or not the peripherals drivers in application code(i.e. 
  *                code will be based on direct access to peripherals registers 
  *                rather than drivers API), this option is controlled by 
  *                "#define USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER"
  *              - To change few application-specific parameters such as the HSE 
  *                crystal frequency
  *           - Data structures and the address mapping for all peripherals
  *           - Peripheral's registers declarations and bits definition
  *           - Macros to access peripherals registers hardware
