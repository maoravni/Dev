Synopsis
--------

libcintelhex is a C library for parsing Intel HEX files and mapping their
binary contents into application or device memory.

Installation
------------

### Requirements

libcintelhex has no requirements besides a halfway recent GCC and a C standard
library. Compilation on Windows with MinGW has also reported to be successful,
building with Clang is still problematic, though.

When cloning from Git, you will also need autoreconf to generate the build system.

### Compilation

Installation as usual:

    autoreconf -i
	./configure
	make
	make install

Usage
-----

After installation, include `cintelhex.h` and add `-lcintelhex` to your linker flags.

### Reading Intel HEX data

This library can parse Intel HEX data either from an input file or directly
from a given string:

    ihex_recordset_t* r1 = ihex_rs_from_file("my_filename");

    char* input = ":1a01000021A4B2Fe...";
    ihex_recordset_t* r2 = ihex_rs_from_string(input);

### Applying Intel HEX data

Intel HEX data can be copied to any region in memory (either somewhere in RAM,
but also to mapped memory regions of hardware devices):

    void* dst = malloc(8192); // Allocate target region.
    int   r   = ihex_mem_copy(rs, dst, 8192,
        IHEX_WIDTH_32BIT, IHEX_ORDER_BIGENDIAN); // Copy data to target region.

    if (r == 0) printf("All is well.\n");
    else return r;
