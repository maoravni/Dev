Ideally TCP_SND_BUF should be many times greater than TCP_MSS.

This is due to the queuelen being stored in an 8 bit value.  Someone
posted a simple modification earlier in the week should you wish to
use a larger queuelen, but in practice most people will be limited by
the SND_BUF before the QUEUELEN plays any part.

Be careful about setting this too small.  lwIP just counts the number
of times its timer is called and uses this to control time sensitive
operations (such as TCP retransmissions), rather than actually
measuring time using something more accurate.  If you call the timer
functions very frequently you may see things (such as retransmissions)
happening sooner than they should.

Yes.  Ideally TCP_WND should be your link bandwidth multiplied by the round 
trip time.

This will send window updates more often which will in some
circumstances improve performance, but could in others reduce it.
Sadly this is true of much in TCP - it's impossible to tune it for all
situations!

Those all sound like pretty good, sensible values for the parameters.
THanks for posting your summary and results.  I'm sure others will
find it useful.

Not sure about this, but can believe that's true.

yep.

yep.

That's a bit of a hack, and not particularly reliable (depends on the stack 
you're sending to).  Much better to configure your window size large enough so 
that TCP can send more than one packet before becoming window limited.

-1- For those who have to write a new ethernet driver (ethernetif.c) for a MAC 
which does not support DMA copy: creating/checking the checksums for IP/UDP/TCP 
can be done on-the-fly so you don't have to load the same data twice into the 
processor. This speeded things up for me, but it's not that easy to implement 
(and DMA copy might be faster anyway).

-2- When using the socket- (or callback-) interface, input data is copied from 
the pbufs into the application buffer using single byte copies. Depending on 
your platform, this can take much longer than copying with the width of your 
data bus. I implemented this change in api_lib.c/netbuf_copy_partial() and 
submitted a patch for this, but I don't think it's included in CVS for now (or 
will be :). But it did boost my receive performance.

-3- Although you probably already have done this, I think it's worth to mention 
again and again: The biggest performance boost (at least for me) came by 
selecting the best lwip_standard_chksum() in inet.c. (Of course this is only 
valid if you don't take option -1- as described above...)

This is a great summary for others who are trying to do the same thing.
